## How to contribute?
No PRs, we are using [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/hiromi-corp/swhq) to translate, please contact Miyu#9404 on [Discord](https://discordapp.com) if you are interested in contributing. Join requests without prior messaging will be ignored.

## GUIDELINES for Transifex
* If a translation exists already for that line, ask about it on Discord or add a suggestion to the line.
* ONLY translate Japanese text, which means to keep the following:
* Do NOT remove any parameters (ex. {0}, {1}), in those come Character Names, Areas, etc...
* Keep "\n", they represent a Line Feed (new line) in game.
* Do NOT edit the lines starting with "ID=" and do NOT translate them.
* Do NOT edit the HTML code (there are a some lines that use HTML for coloring) unless you know what are you doing.
* Use ASCII (English) commas, dots, exclamation/question marks, etc...
* Keep Japanese the onomatopoeia and Japanese honorifics in translations (ex. Auauau, Onee-chan).
